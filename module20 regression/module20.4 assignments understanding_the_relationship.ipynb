This means that the increase in the target is lower for high values of windspeed than for low values of windspeed. So, the windspeed mitigates the effect of humidity increase on the target.

    "- learn to interprete interaction variables. i.e. According to the model, the coefficient of the interaction term is -0.30. We can interpret it as follows. Given a windspeed level, 1 point increase in humidity results in 0.18 - 0.30 X windspeed point increase in the target. This means that the increase in the target is lower for high values of windspeed than for low values of windspeed. So, the windspeed mitigates the effect of humidity increase on the target. Similarly for a given humidity level, 1 point increase in the windspeed results in 0.09 - 0.30 X humidity point increase in the target. So, the humidity also mitigates the effect of windspeed on the target."
