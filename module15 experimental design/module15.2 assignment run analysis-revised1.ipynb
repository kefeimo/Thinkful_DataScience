    "# 1. Introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many companies are facing the problem of recruiting and retaining talents while at the same time having to deal with talent loss through attrition. Losing talents and employees result in performance losses and can have a long-term negative effect on the companies. Besides, attrition might leave gaps in its execution and human resource team, and causes loss of work team harmony and social goodwill. There are many factors that might result in attribution, issues of salary, lack of career mobility and challenges, working environment, just to name a few. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this research, we will look into the data of IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance. By studying employee profiles, we would like to answer what factors are more likely to cause attrition, and what potential methods can be applied to reduce attrition rate.\n"

In our test, it means the male employees and female employees are the same except the gender. But this might not be necessarily true and can bring bias to the experiment. Consider the scenario that, the male employee group has more young people, who are actually more likely to quit. While the female group has more employees feeling more stressed, who are more likely the group. These two factors might “average out” the effect between male and female sample groups, and that’s why there is no significant difference between the two sample groups. To test whether such influences exist, we can conduct A/B test to exam whether the two sample groups are significant in age, stress level, and other variables of interest."
